If an Ethernet frame comes up 
into the Ethernet driver off t
henetwork, the packet can be p
assed upwards to either the AR
P (AddressResolution Protocol)
 module or to the IP (Internet
 Protocol) module.The value of
 the type field in the Etherne
t frame determines whetherthe 
Ethernet frame is passed to th
e ARP or the IP module.If an I
P packet comes up into IP, the
 unit of data is passed upward
sto either TCP or UDP, as dete
rmined by the value of the pro
tocolfield in the IP header.If
 the UDP datagram comes up int
o UDP, the application message
 ispassed upwards to the netwo
rk application based on the va
lue of theport field in the UD
P header.  If the TCP message 
comes up into TCP,the applicat
ion message is passed upwards 
to the network applicationbase
d on the value of the port fie
ld in the TCP header.The downw
ards multiplexing is simple to
 perform because from eachstar
ting point there is only the o
ne downward path; each protoco
lmodule adds its header inform
ation so the packet can be de-
multiplexed at the destination
 computer.Data passing out fro
m the applications through eit
her TCP or UDPconverges on the
 IP module and is sent downwar
ds through the lowernetwork in
terface driver.Although intern
et technology supports many di
fferent network media,Ethernet
 is used for all examples in t
his tutorial because it is the
most common physical network u
sed under IP.  The computer in
 Figure 1has a single Ethernet
 connection.  The 6-byte Ether
net address isunique for each 
interface on an Ethernet and i
s located at the lowerinterfac
e of the Ethernet driver.The c
omputer also has a 4-byte IP a
ddress.  This address is locat
edat the lower interface to th
e IP module.  The IP address m
